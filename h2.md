Niko presented us a quick overview on security strategy. A strategy that every
company should have but few actually do. For my case study I used a real company
as a base, trying my best to anonymize it here, and then used my best guess on
things that I have no knowledge of.

## Case: A 600+ personnel Company

IT opertions are divided to two departments. One that is responsible for the
infrastructure and servers etc., and one that works on software development for
clients.

Security is part of both departments every day work but with minor differences.
Infra side has the responsibility to keep servers and firewalls and so on
update, whereas developers department needs to be prepared to handle security
issues in code or thir party libraries.

### Current Strategy

IT Security is not mentioned in the company strategy. There are mentios about
providing customers with safety related prouducts and that companys production
systems should be the best in the world. But security as a strategy is not
brought up and there is no separate securtity strategy in place.

### Outsourcing

Cloud services and outsourcing development is commonly used in both
IT-departments. It is currently well understood that developing some things
in-house is not feasible in the long term. Using open source solutions and
open data is infact mentioned in the company strategy, so perhaps this can be
seen as a kind of a security aspect in the strategy then.

### Incidents

Bugs and vulnerabilities are handled when they occur. Little planning is done in
advance. As an example there was a case when a database password was thought
to have been leaked. Changing the possibly compromised credentials and updating
them to all required parts in production took a long time. Should the company
have more foresight to this kind of incidents there could have been a ready
process to handle the issue.

### Budgeting

There is no separate budget for security related matters in company wide budget.
Security is seen as a thing that the IT department handles and therefor the
security budget is derived from the IT departments, and specifically the
infrastructure departments budget.

### Red Teaming

It not done regularly but there has been a sort of red teaming tests to find
vulnerabilities in companys products and infrastructure. The tests were
conducted by a thid party and the found issues were reported. The issues were
then prioritized and given a schedule (and fixed in the end).

## Recommendations

The IT personnel are highly trained and capable of fixing security issues
and developing secure software. The things are slowly moving to better direction
where it is understood that just being able to react to incidents is not as good
as preparing to handle security incidents beforehand. The company could become
more proactive in handling of security.

### Top Business Expectations

As it was said in Niko's presentation security is part of everything. All of the
company functions connect to security one way or another.

Security strategy should be derived from the company wide strategy. It need to
be identified how security affects each of the company goals. This should
be done side by side with the company strategy and not as an afterthought. The
security related issues may have an impact on the company wide strategy and vice
versa.

There is a need for IT savy personnel who also understand the business side and
know how to communicate the security requirements to the heads of the company
without the IT jargon.

There is always a business side for each security issue. SLAs can dictate
monetary compensation to customers, if the company web site is unavailable they
can lose potential customers.

Company's clients comprise mostly other IT businesses that are becoming more
security aware and know what to demand for. There is no way to avoid security
becoming bigger and more important part of the operations. If it is not taken
seriously, there is a big risk in losing business.

### Identify What You Already Have

The IT personnel are well versed in security related issues but the know-how can
consist of a lot of silent knowledge and what is common practice in other
department may be a completely new thing in other. There is a lot of security
best practices that should be shared and trained across IT departments and the
whole company. The company is good at evaluating what to outsource and what to
do in-house. But there are sometimes difficulties within the different IT
departments to focus on the core competence.

It should be in the company strategy as well as in
the security strategy defined the strategic goals for the company and it should
be the responsibility of the heads of the departments to interprete the startegy
in to practice.

### Strategic Business Targets

Security strategy should contain plans for several years ahead. It is not
possible to prepare for individual incidents, but there are megatrends and
weak signals that relate to IT security and IT in general. These should be taken
in to account when selecting strategic business targets.

It's not enought to just pick latest fads from an list of new technology. It
is essential to know what is necessary for the company to cope and thrive in the
coming years. It is better to justify for example the purchase of new infrastructure
through how it affects the business operations. It could be explained as what is
the value of the new purchase, how moch money does it save or how much money
will it return in the following years. How much money will be lost if the
security is lacking and how much money can be won if the security is in order.

The security strategy should be updated regularly. The targes will change over
time and with changing targets also the practices from the strategy will change.
Changes withing a large company don't happen over night and take time. Leading
these changes is essential for a succesfull implementation of a strategy.
