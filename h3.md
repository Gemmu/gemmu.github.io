The very first thing was to update the VirtualBox and the Guest Additions. At
first the bidirectional clip board wasn't working, and using copy paste between
host and guest system helps tremendously. After that following installation
instructions for Docker and WebGoat was very easy. I have to mention here that
`docker.io` package is [no longer the preferred method][1] of installing Docker
on Ubuntu, but I already spent a bit too much time with the Guest Additions, so
I didn't update Docker for this task.

### Bypass a Path Based Access Control Scheme

I used Firefox's developer tools to edit the HTML values for select box.
At first I tried to set first options value to `WEB-INF/spring-security.xml`,
but I only got error message: "No such file or directory".

Value of `../` returned error message: "Is a directory", so I guess

Value of `../*` returned agail "No such file or directory" -message.

An exact filename seems to be required for this to work. I went up the directory
tree `../../../WEB-INF/spring-security.xml`, and got a new message from WebGoat:

> It appears that you are on the right track. Commands that may compromise the
> operating system have been disabled. You are only allowed to see one file in
> this directory.

I'm not sure what this means but it's a good sign I guess. Going up one more
level resulted again tin No such file or directory -error. So the right palce
seems to be the `../../../WEB-INF/`. I just can figure out what is the one file
that is allowed to be seen.

I had to resort to view the solution, which eplained that

> ...replacing it with `../main.jsp` which is a file located in a folder below
> the current directory.
>
> Current Directory is:
> `/.extract/webapps/WebGoat/plugin_extracted/plugin/StoredXss/lessonPlans/en`

So I tried to replace the value with `../main.jsp` and still got an error: "The
following error occurred while accessing the file: `/.extract/webapps/WebGoat/plugin_extracted/plugin/PathBasedAccessControl/lessonPlans/en/../main.jsp`
(No such file or directory)"

Either there is something wrong with my WebGoat setup, or the solution is wrong.

But I was determined to find this mystery .jsp-file, so I hunted it down from my
container named `relaxed_goodall`.

```shell
docker exec -it relaxed_goodall find /.extract -name main.jsp
/.extract/webapps/WebGoat/main.jsp
```

That lead to victory:

> Congratulations! Access to file allowed. ==> `/.extract/webapps/WebGoat/main.jsp`
>
> Current Directory is: `/.extract/webapps/WebGoat/plugin_extracted/plugin/StoredXss/lessonPlans/en`

It seems that to find the main.jsp file one has to walk five levels up the
directory tree. Not just three (or one as the solution suggested).

So the solution was to set one options value to
`../../../../../main.jsp`. This gave access to the whole file.

```java
Viewing file: /.extract/webapps/WebGoat/main.jsp<%@ page contentType="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1" language="java"
import="org.owasp.webgoat.session.*, org.owasp.webgoat.lessons.Category, org.owasp.webgoat.lessons.AbstractLesson, org.owasp.webgoat.util.*, java.util.*"
errorPage="" %>
<%
WebSession webSession = ((WebSession) session.getAttribute(WebSession.SESSION));
Course course = webSession.getCourse();
AbstractLesson currentLesson = webSession.getCurrentLesson();
LabelManager labelManager = BeanProvider.getBean("labelManager", LabelManager.class);
%>
...
and so on
```

I have to say that this task was a bit difficult without any knowledge on how
Java's web applications are structured. If know what you are looking for, it is
easier to find it.

### LAB: Role Based Access Control

#### Stage 1: Bypass Presentational Layer Access Control

Continuing with Firefox's developer tools, clicking the login buttons reveals
that a request is posted with a payload of

```text
employee_id=105&password=tom&action=Login
```

The field name "action" gives an idea how to manipulate the system. Perhaps
replacing the content with a different directive. After logging in there
is a button labeled ViewProfile. This also makes a http post with ViewProfile
as an action.

Editing the HTML as in previous riddle. This time changing the button
value from `ViewProfile` to `DeleteProfile` resulted in success.

### Stage 3: Breaking Data Layer Access Control

Stage 2 was marked as developer version only so that was skipped. Alhouth it may
have been quite educational.

The web Inspector with Firefox reveals employee ID's that are integers that
range from 101 to 112.

* Log in as user Tom
* Edit form to contain employee_id=101 instead of 105.

Success here! Stage 4 is again marked as developer only and is there for
skipped.

### LAB: Client Side Filtering

#### Stage 1: What is Neville Bartholomew's salary

Inspector again reveals that the program calls a `fetchUserData()`-function

But even further inspection reveals a hidden HTML-table, which contains all
the required data.

```html
<table style="display: none" id="hiddenEmployeeRecords" width="90%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" border="1" align="center"><div>
<table width="90%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1" align="center"><tbody><tr><td>UserID</td><td>First Name</td><td>Last Name</td><td>SSN</td><td>Salary</td></tr><tr id="101"><td>101</td><td>Larry</td><td>Stooge</td><td>386-09-5451</td><td>55000</td></tr><tr id="102"><td>102</td><td>Moe</td><td>Stooge</td><td>936-18-4524</td><td>140000</td></tr><tr id="103"><td>103</td><td>Curly</td><td>Stooge</td><td>961-08-0047</td><td>50000</td></tr><tr id="104"><td>104</td><td>Eric</td><td>Walker</td><td>445-66-5565</td><td>13000</td></tr><tr id="105"><td>105</td><td>Tom</td><td>Cat</td><td>792-14-6364</td><td>80000</td></tr><tr id="106"><td>106</td><td>Jerry</td><td>Mouse</td><td>858-55-4452</td><td>70000</td></tr><tr id="107"><td>107</td><td>David</td><td>Giambi</td><td>439-20-9405</td><td>100000</td></tr><tr id="108"><td>108</td><td>Bruce</td><td>McGuirre</td><td>707-95-9482</td><td>110000</td></tr><tr id="109"><td>109</td><td>Sean</td><td>Livingston</td><td>136-55-1046</td><td>130000</td></tr><tr id="110"><td>110</td><td>Joanne</td><td>McDougal</td><td>789-54-2413</td><td>90000</td></tr><tr id="111"><td>111</td><td>John</td><td>Wayne</td><td>129-69-4572</td><td>200000</td></tr><tr id="112"><td>112</td><td>Neville</td><td>Bartholomew</td><td>111-111-1111</td><td>450000</td></tr></tbody></table>
```

Stage 2 requires the developer version so it is skipped. I have to say that the
solution might be not to have discreet information on the HTML source code in
the first place.
