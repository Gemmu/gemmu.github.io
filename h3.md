## a)

> Solve four riddles from WebGoat. Skip the ones that are "for developer version
> only" or require modifying WebGoat source code inside Docker container. You
> can use any tasks, but the ones near the start are easier. Explain step by
> step how you exploited the app. (For this task, you'll need to install
> WebGoat. Check links and literature above. WebGoat runs on your own machine,
> so make sure the address starts with "localhost")

## b

> Use OWASP 10 to name each type of vulnerability you used in part a.

## c

> Real life? For each of the vulnerabilites you found, explain how it could be
> used in real life. For example, if you get a javascript alert, so what? How
> common do you think that this vulnerability is? Can you find any reference
> to support your view? (Non-academic references are OK)

## d

> How could companies protect themselves against the problems you considered
> in a-c? Try to view this on different levels, from code to strategy.

## e

> Voluntary: Solve 15 WebGoat challenges. It makes sense to use as simple and
> easy to use tools as possible, but you might need something more. In case you
> need it, mitmproxy is my favourite testing proxy.

## f

> Voluntary: Invited. Get an invite to Hack The Box. This is a simple
> javascript/web hacking challenge. Stay within scope.
> <https://www.hackthebox.eu/invite> (ps. If you do get an invite: If you get
> inside the network and set up VPN, only continue if you know how to use the
> required tools safely; understand their rules; follow your tools with other
> tools; double-triple check IP addresses; and stay within the scope given.)
