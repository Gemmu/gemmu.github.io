The very first thing was to update the VirtualBox and the Guest Additions. At
first the bidirectional clip board wasn't working, and using copy paste between
host and guest system helps tremendously. After that following installation
instructions for Docker and WebGoat was very easy. I have to mention here that
`docker.io` package is [no longer the preferred method][1] of installing Docker
on Ubuntu, but I already spent a bit too much time with the Guest Additions, so
I didn't update Docker for this task.

### a.1

> Bypass a Path Based Access Control Scheme

I used Firefox's developer tools to edit the HTML values for select box.
At first I tried to set first options value to `WEB-INF/spring-security.xml`,
but I only got error message: "No such file or directory".

Value of `../` returned error message: "Is a directory", so I guess

Value of `../*` returned agail "No such file or directory" -message.

An exact filename seems to be required for this to work. I went up the directory
tree `../../../WEB-INF/spring-security.xml`, and got a new message from WebGoat:

> It appears that you are on the right track. Commands that may compromise the
> operating system have been disabled. You are only allowed to see one file in
> this directory.

I'm not sure what this means but it's a good sign I guess. Going up one more
level resulted again tin No such file or directory -error. So the right palce
seems to be the `../../../WEB-INF/`. I just can figure out what is the one file
that is allowed to be seen.

I had to resort to view the solution, which eplained that

> ...replacing it with `../main.jsp` which is a file located in a folder below
> the current directory.
>
> Current Directory is:
> `/.extract/webapps/WebGoat/plugin_extracted/plugin/StoredXss/lessonPlans/en`

So I tried to replace the value with `../main.jsp` and still got an error: "The
following error occurred while accessing the file: `/.extract/webapps/WebGoat/plugin_extracted/plugin/PathBasedAccessControl/lessonPlans/en/../main.jsp`
(No such file or directory)"

Either there is something wrong with my WebGoat setup, or the solution is wrong.

But I was determined to find this mystery .jsp-file, so I hunted it down from my
container named `relaxed_goodall`.

```shell
docker exec -it relaxed_goodall find /.extract -name main.jsp
/.extract/webapps/WebGoat/main.jsp
```

That lead to victory:

> Congratulations! Access to file allowed. ==> `/.extract/webapps/WebGoat/main.jsp`
>
> Current Directory is: `/.extract/webapps/WebGoat/plugin_extracted/plugin/StoredXss/lessonPlans/en`

It seems that to find the main.jsp file one has to walk five levels up the
directory tree. Not just three (or one as the solution suggested).

So the solution was to set one options value to
`../../../../../main.jsp`. This gave access to the whole file.

```java
Viewing file: /.extract/webapps/WebGoat/main.jsp<%@ page contentType="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1" language="java"
import="org.owasp.webgoat.session.*, org.owasp.webgoat.lessons.Category, org.owasp.webgoat.lessons.AbstractLesson, org.owasp.webgoat.util.*, java.util.*"
errorPage="" %>
<%
WebSession webSession = ((WebSession) session.getAttribute(WebSession.SESSION));
Course course = webSession.getCourse();
AbstractLesson currentLesson = webSession.getCurrentLesson();
LabelManager labelManager = BeanProvider.getBean("labelManager", LabelManager.class);
%>
...
and so on
```

I have to say that this task was a bit difficult without any knowledge on how
Java's web applications are structured. If know what you are looking for, it is
easier to find it.

### a.2

> LAB: Role Based Access Control

#### Stage 1: Bypass Presentational Layer Access Control

Continuing with Firefox's developer tools, clicking the login buttons reveals
that a request is posted with a payload of

```text
employee_id=105&password=tom&action=Login
```

The field name "action" gives an idea how to manipulate the system. Perhaps
replacing the content with a different directive. After logging in there
is a button labeled ViewProfile. This also makes a http post with ViewProfile
as an action.

Editing the HTML as in previous riddle. This time changing the button
value from `ViewProfile` to `DeleteProfile` resulted in success.

### Stage 3: Breaking Data Layer Access Control

Stage 2 was marked as developer version only so that was skipped. Alhouth it may
have been quite educational.

The web Inspector with Firefox reveals employee ID's that are integers that
range from 101 to 112.

* Log in as user Tom
* Edit form to contain employee_id=101 instead of 105.

Success here! Stage 4 is again marked as developer only and is there for
skipped.

### a.3

LAB: Client Side Filtering

#### Stage 1: What is Neville Bartholomew's salary

Inspector again reveals that the program calls a `fetchUserData()`-function

But even further inspection reveals a hidden HTML-table, which contains all
the required data.

```html
<table style="display: none" id="hiddenEmployeeRecords" width="90%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" border="1" align="center"><div>
<table width="90%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1" align="center"><tbody><tr><td>UserID</td><td>First Name</td><td>Last Name</td><td>SSN</td><td>Salary</td></tr><tr id="101"><td>101</td><td>Larry</td><td>Stooge</td><td>386-09-5451</td><td>55000</td></tr><tr id="102"><td>102</td><td>Moe</td><td>Stooge</td><td>936-18-4524</td><td>140000</td></tr><tr id="103"><td>103</td><td>Curly</td><td>Stooge</td><td>961-08-0047</td><td>50000</td></tr><tr id="104"><td>104</td><td>Eric</td><td>Walker</td><td>445-66-5565</td><td>13000</td></tr><tr id="105"><td>105</td><td>Tom</td><td>Cat</td><td>792-14-6364</td><td>80000</td></tr><tr id="106"><td>106</td><td>Jerry</td><td>Mouse</td><td>858-55-4452</td><td>70000</td></tr><tr id="107"><td>107</td><td>David</td><td>Giambi</td><td>439-20-9405</td><td>100000</td></tr><tr id="108"><td>108</td><td>Bruce</td><td>McGuirre</td><td>707-95-9482</td><td>110000</td></tr><tr id="109"><td>109</td><td>Sean</td><td>Livingston</td><td>136-55-1046</td><td>130000</td></tr><tr id="110"><td>110</td><td>Joanne</td><td>McDougal</td><td>789-54-2413</td><td>90000</td></tr><tr id="111"><td>111</td><td>John</td><td>Wayne</td><td>129-69-4572</td><td>200000</td></tr><tr id="112"><td>112</td><td>Neville</td><td>Bartholomew</td><td>111-111-1111</td><td>450000</td></tr></tbody></table>
```

Stage 2 requires the developer version so it is skipped. I have to say that the
solution might be not to have discreet information on the HTML source code in
the first place.

### a.4

> DOM Injection. Enable the activate button

Just edited the HTML again to remove the `disabled=""` attribute of the button
and to include `enabled=""` instead. After clickin the button, the lesson was
marked complete.

## b

> Use OWASP 10 to name each type of vulnerability you used in part a.

[First riddle](#a.1) was solved with [Broken Access Control][2]. The files that should
not be accessible were not properly protected and could be read by unauthorized
user. I also thought that maybe it could be interpreted as a
[Security Misconfiguration][3] too, because a file was accessible when it could
propably be configured not to be. This depends on the web server and I'm not
that familiar with Tomcat which seems to be in use in the WebGoat.

The lesson was a bit difficult to complete because of either the Current
Directory was wrong in the lesson, or perhaps there was something wrong with my
WebGoat setup.

[The second one](#a.2) was the same [Broken Access Control][2] vulnerability I
suppose. But this time it was a bit easier to solve. User could gain access to
methods that should have been restricted to administrative accounts.

[Third riddle](#a.3) was about [Sensitive Data Exposure][4]. Personal
information was available in the HTML source code. There seems to be a common
misconception within beginning HTML coders that comments or hidden fields would
not be visible to users. This can be a bit confusing especially when PHP or
other serverside code is used. Different templating systems can help at least
with hiding code comments from users. But using hidden tables to store data
shouldn't be necessary in modern web pages.

[Fourth] is propably [Injection][5] as the lessons name was DOM Injection.
This is when the client is able to send malicious data to web server without
proper filtering and is able to for example have unauthorized access to data.

I think that more and more web sites now use somekind of ready framework, and
it is less common to create web pages from scratch with HTML and JavaScript.
This can improve the security if the frameworks and web servers are kept up to
date. Some companies do still suffer from [Not Invented Here Syndrom (NIHS)][6]
and insist on coding things themselves. Or perhaps it is that they have not done
enough research on the subject and aren't aware of any ready solutions.

An example of Broken Access Control could perhaps be the [incident last year][7]
with personal information that was availble through Trafis drivers licences
system. Too detailed and sensitive information was available to public and
the service was quickly shut down for almost a year, until it was
[reopened with limited information available][8] to the public. This incident
didn't really require any "hacking" by the users. Perhaps this could also be
a case of Sensitive Data Exposure.

Oracle had an SQL injection issue which could be [used for bank frauds][9].

You need to keep your software updated and patched, but what if you rely on
third party software (like Oracle's)? There needs to be balance between paranoid
NIHS and total third party control.

Always follow best practices if there is no good justification to do otherwise.

When using open source solutions reserve time to follow the development and if
at all possible take active part in the developments. There are many ways to
participate in open source projects and it is not necessarely required to be
able to  work on code. Adding new issues to projects bug tracking systems,
translating projects and taking part in conversations are also very good ways
to improve the software and make it safer to use.

The famous quote (Linus's law) that with enough eye balls, every bug is shallow.
This sounds about right and it is much easier to find security vulnerabilities
from opensource than from a black box closed system. Or at least you don't
necessarely have to wait for the provicer to make a patch. You can do it
yourself. Taking part in open source projects should be included in the
security budget when the code is used by the company.

## e

> Voluntary: Solve 15 WebGoat challenges.

I only had time for three :/

### e.1 XML Injection

> add more rewards to your allowed set of reward

Sending my account ID reveals a low balance. Trying different ID's for
submitting, but without luck.

Submitting the account ID opens a form with checkboxes. Adding new checkboxes is
easy with the inspector, and I added new ones and incremented the integer values
they had by one. This completed the lesson.

### e.2 JSON Injection

The web form seems to be broken. Both radiobuttons can be selected and neither
can be unselected. This is not how radio buttons should work. But this is
not the lesson here.

Javascript reads the flight price directly from the HTML table.

Inspecting the HTML reveals a hidden input field with id `price2Submit` which is
filled with the table data

```javascript
document.getElementById('price2Submit').value = document.getElementById('priceID0').innerHTML;
```

By editing the table before submitting the form, we can have a lower price.

### e.3 Silent Transactions Attacks

I'm not sure if I accomplished this the right way. But Firefox's web inspector
has a JavaScipt console, where it is possible to call the function
`submitData()` with arguments depicting account number and amount. Giving an
account number of `0` and amount of `1000` resulted in completion of lesson.

I didn't quite get this lesson until I checked the lessons point from the
solution:

> The latest generation of browsers allows to call JavaScript from the address
> bar, using `javascript:function();`.
> Try to execute: `javascript:submitData(1234556,11000);`

I didn't know this before, but I don't think that spamming just this JavaScript
bit will result in to anything as it is stated in after completing the lesson.
With a bit of looking around it was revealed that this functionality is luckily
[now disabled by default in the Firefox][10].
