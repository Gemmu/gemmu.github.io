## a.1

> Give practical examples of protecting and violating CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability).

Protecting confidentiality is about protecting information from unauthorized
access. Just keeping doors (and computers) locked is protecting confidentiality.
File persmissions on linux is for protecting against unauthorized access too.

Breaking in to someone elses office or computer (or home) is a clear violation
of at least confidentiality.

Intergity is to protect informations accuracy and consistency. Web sites often
provide file checksums for downloaders to check that they did get the correct
file when downloading. If a file has a different checksum the content has been
changed.

Deliberately providing wrong information is violating information integrity.

Availability to have the information where it is required when it is required.
Keeping computers running with an UPS during a power outage is on way to
protect informations availability.

Cutting data lines during road work would break data availability.

## a.2

> Name an unbreakable cipher and explain how it works. Can you name an example from history where a mistake in applying this algorithm has lead to disclosure of confidential data?

One-time pad was mentioned as unbreakable. Althoug both the sender and the
reciver need to have the same encryption key available. So the key distribution
can be a problem.

I couldn't quite figure out the explanation for the one-time pad, so I read some
more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad).
Unfortunately the examples there assigned zero leading numers to each letter
when the example in the book start from 1. I did get a bit confused for awhile,
because calculating the example would produce different result.

With A=1, B=2

> O + T mod 26 = I
> N + B mod 26 = P
> E + F mod 26 = K

With A=0, B=1 and so on:

```text
      O       N       E       T       I  message
  14 (O)  13 (N)   4 (E)  19 (T)   9 (I) message
+ 19 (T)   1 (B)   5 (F)  17 (R)   6 (G) key
= 33      14       9      26      15     message + key
=  7 (G)  14 (O)   9 (J)   0 (A)  15 (P) (message + key) mod 26
      G       O       J       A       P  → ciphertext
```

But then again Schneiers example did't tell how the letter values were counted.

Schneier mentions that without truly random source for keys the encryption could
possibly be broken. According to Wikipedia there have been several cases where
one-time pad has been broken due to using the same pad more than once or not
random enough of key.


## b

> Encrypt a message symmetrically, using any program you like.

I used a program named `gpg` for this task.

```shell
cd encrypt
~/encrypt$ echo Ahoy! > message.txt
~/encrypt$ cat message.txt
Ahoy!
~/encrypt$ gpg --symmetric message.txt
~/encrypt$ ls
message.txt  message.txt.gpg
~/encrypt$ cat message.txt.gpg

```

And back again

```shell
~/encrypt$ gpg --decrypt message.txt.gpg
gpg: AES256 encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
Ahoy!

```

## c

Generating keys. Note that I have a user named Joni Taikina (John Doe).
Hence the `/home/joni`.

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Encrypting the message

```shell

~/encrypt$ gpg --encrypt --recipient 'Test Man' mesg2.txt
gpg: checking the trustdb

And decrypting it...

```shell
~/encrypt$ gpg --decrypt mesg2.txt.gpg
gpg: encrypted with 3072-bit RSA key, ID A1CA02E434207C14, created 2020-05-03

gpg: public key decryption failed: Bad passphrase
gpg: decryption failed: No secret key
```

I already had forgotten the password for the encryption key I created earlier.
The message is now very secure indeed.

## d

> Give examples of encryption algorithms that are computationally secure; and examples of those that are not.

Schenier mentions DES, RSA and DSA as most common secure algorithms. And the
previously mentioned one-time pad.

As insecure algorithms XOR is listed alongside with Substitution Ciphers and
Transposition Ciphers.


## e

> Find Diffie, Whitfield, and Martin Hellman: "New Directions in Cryptography".

> What problem does it solve?

From the paper: "Widening application of teleprocessing have given rise to a
need for new types of cryptographic systems, which mimimize the need for secure
key distribution channes and supply the equivalent of a written signature."

A name "trap-door cryptosystem" was mentioned for producing a public key
distribution syste.

> When was it published?

It was published in November 1976

> How was this problem solved before this idea?

Again a direct quote from the paper: "...communicating parties to share a key
which is known to no one else. This is done by sending the key in advance over
some secure channel such as private courier or registered mail"

> Have you ever used any of these techniques in your own life?

I use public key authentication at work every day. But I do not really think
about it that much. It's always a big task to set up new key pairs if neede.
I also use public key authentication for pushing commits to GitHub repositories.

I wish this would be more generally in use with email, but I guess Google
couldn't make as much profit with ads if they couldn't read users mail.

## f

Amazons Alexa was marketed as safe and secure, but it was (or is?) not.

## g

> Decrypt this cyphertext "Zpv bsf b ibdlfs!"

'I' being a common word in english, transpose each letter forwards 7 times.

"Gwc izm i piksmz!"

Makes no sense. Perhaps 'I' isn't as common as 'a' within an english sentece.
If 'b' is in fact 'a', transpose each ciphertext letter one backwards.

"You are a hacker!"

Maybe not just yet :)
