## a.1

> Give practical examples of protecting and violating CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability).

Protecting confidentiality is about protecting information from unauthorized
access. Just keeping doors (and computers) locked is protecting confidentiality.
File persmissions on linux is for protecting against unauthorized access too.

Breaking in to someone elses office or computer (or home) is a clear violation
of at least confidentiality.

Intergity is to protect informations accuracy and consistency. Web sites often
provide file checksums for downloaders to check that they did get the correct
file when downloading. If a file has a different checksum the content has been
changed.

Deliberately providing wrong information is violating information integrity.

Availability to have the information where it is required when it is required.
Keeping computers running with an UPS during a power outage is on way to
protect informations availability.

Cutting data lines during road work would break data availability.

## a.2

> Name an unbreakable cipher and explain how it works. Can you name an example from history where a mistake in applying this algorithm has lead to disclosure of confidential data?

One-time pad was mentioned as unbreakable. Althoug both the sender and the 
reciver need to have the same encryption key available. So the key distribution 
can be a problem.

I couldn't quite figure out the explanation for the one-time pad, so I read some
more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad).
Unfortunately the examples there assigned zero leading numers to each letter
when the example in the book start from 1. I did get a bit confused for awhile,
because calculating the example would produce different result.

With A=1, B=2

> O + T mod 26 = I
> N + B mod 26 = P
> E + F mod 26 = K

With A=0, B=1 and so on:

```text
      O       N       E       T       I  message
  14 (O)  13 (N)   4 (E)  19 (T)   9 (I) message
+ 19 (T)   1 (B)   5 (F)  17 (R)   6 (G) key
= 33      14       9      26      15     message + key
=  7 (G)  14 (O)   9 (J)   0 (A)  15 (P) (message + key) mod 26
      G       O       J       A       P  → ciphertext
```

But then again Schneiers example did't tell how the letter values were counted.

Schneier mentions that without truly random source for keys the encryption could
possibly be broken. According to Wikipedia there have been several cases where
one-time pad has been broken due to using the same pad more than once or not
random enough of key. 


## b

> Encrypt a message symmetrically, using any program you like.

I used a program named `gpg` for this task.

```shell
cd encrypt
~/encrypt$ echo Ahoy! > message.txt
~/encrypt$ cat message.txt
Ahoy!
~/encrypt$ gpg --symmetric message.txt
~/encrypt$ ls
message.txt  message.txt.gpg
~/encrypt$ cat message.txt.gpg

Have you ever used any of these techniques in your own life? This is a very well known article, so third party sources can also give you answers to these questions - you don't need to read and understand the whole article to answer the questions.
