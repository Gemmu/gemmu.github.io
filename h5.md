The Onion Router, commonly referred at “Tor”

Distracts tracking of _who_ visited a web site. It does not hide the fact that
a webite was visited and it does not hide what was done.

I guess if the target site would use HTTPS then the connection would also be
secure

Use cases 
> Businesses use Tor to browse a competitor’s website to avoid the competitor logging the traffic. Whistleblowers, government agents and informants, and tourists use the Tor browser to protect their communications from being disclosed for legitimate communications. Law enforcement should encourage the use of Tor in their investigations to avoid suspects being aware of government IP addresses looking at websites being investigated.

Legality of hosting an exit node.

If the governament is oppressive then acting as just a Tor relay may be illegal and
can get you in to a lot of trouble.

Cencoring is done to known Tor relays (or nodes). There are unlisted Tor
addresses (bridges) that can be manually configured to access the Tor network.

One problem is that exit nodes can hosted by the oppressive government... 
but does exit node know the original sender?

There were dosens Tor related apps in Apples Appstore. Is any of them the 
official version? How would one know?


The forensics part was a little over my head.

> One of the weaknesses, if not the biggest weakness, of the Tor browser is the user. 

> deanonymizing Tor by attacking and disabling a large percentage of the Tor network 

>  _if_ the communications are encrypted end-to-end, capturing the traffic does not decrypt the contents of messages.


What is Tails? 

> As Tor is a browser that can be used anonymously, Tails (The Amnesic Incognito Live System) is a complete operating system that can be used anonymously.

> Tails does not leave any trace on the host computer system. A Tails user can prevent any forensic artifacts being created since Tails does not touch the host computer hard drive.


What is Tor? What is Onion Router? What is Tor browser?

What are .onion addresses?

> A hidden service is a server on the Tor network that provides a service, such as e-mail or file hosting. 

> Hidden services are not indexed by search engines and therefore, practically invisible to the Internet. Hidden services also do not use exit nodes.

> Hidden service websites are most always accessed with the Tor browser with the top-level domain of the hidden services being “.onion”.

How do these things relate to each other.

> Tor allows anyone to connect to websites that may be blocked by oppressive governments



## a

> Install Tails and access TOR network (.onion addresses). (Explain in detail how you installed it, and how you got access to TOR).

I haven'd has a bittorrent program installed for many many years, but this 
course requires a lot of downloading of files that are available as torrent 
downloads. The torrents are also often the preferred method of downloading.

So I started of by reading what is the best torrent client these days.

According to [How-To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/197542/the-4-best-alternatives-to-utorrent-on-windows/) the once nice uTorrent has 
been aquired by BitTorrent Inc and filled with adverts. The recommended software
is qBittorrent, so I selected that.

The [download page](https://www.fosshub.com/qBittorrent.html) contained File Signatures for verfying the downloaded file and
through 7Zip Windows 10 now contains the ability to calculate SHA256 for files in
Explorer. As the signatures matched I continued my adventure.

On to the Tails. It is was availabl as a [virtual machine image](https://tails.boum.org/install/vm-download/index.en.html) so I selected that, as 
Virtual Box was already installed on my machine.

There were a [few warnings on using virtual machines](https://tails.boum.org/doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/index.en.html). The security could be 
compromised, but for the sake of this excercise I continued with this endeavour.

![New virtual machine dialog](tails-from-iso.jpg?raw=true "Add new virtual machine for Tails")

It was easy to follow installation instructions, but at first start I recieved 
a warning of low memory on host computer.

![Memory issues notification](trouble?raw=true "Memory problems with virtual machine")

I powered off the Tails machine and one Xubuntu virtual machine and some other 
software that was running but wasnt't necessary. Second try worked without 
warnings.

Taking screen shots form Virtual Box was a bit difficult, I guess some of the
`Shift` + `Win` + `S` combination's keys are reserved for some use. I had to
activate another application window to activate the screen shot tool. I also 
learned that one can take screen shots directly from VirtualBOx using 
key combination `Host` + `E`.

I recalled an old [news article from YLE](https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-11035384) that reported that BBC had made their
website available in the Tor network with the address 
https://www.bbcnewsv2vjtpsuy.onion/

The BBC site is available with the normal bbc.com address as well. But the 
difference in using the .onion address (according to the [literature](#z)) is that 


## b

> Browse TOR network, find, take screenshots and comment
>    search engine for onion sites
>    marketplace
>    fraud
>    forum

## c

> Find an example where anonymity of TOR user was compromized. How was it done? Who did it? Could the deanonymization be replicated?

## d

> What other pseudonymous/anonymous networks are there?

## e

> In your own words, how does anonymity work in TOR? (e.g. how does it use: public keys, encryption, what algorithms?)

## f

> What is the threath model for TOR?

## g

> Reserve your presentation topic. Security related. Combine fundamentals of security to business, strategy or practical applications. 5 minutes presentation + written article. Reserve topic on Moodle (HH login required)
