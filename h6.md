### Satoshi Nakamoto 2008: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

> Satoshi Nakamoto 2008: [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System][2].
> This is the paper that defined and introduced BitCoin. You can skip "11.

This must be at least a third time I've tried reading this original description
of Bitcoin system. I have to admit that even the abstract is a bit difficult to
comprehend with its concepts like _proof-of-work_ and _largest pool of CPU_ and
so on. It is either a humbling experience or just frustrating? Or maybe a little
both.

It does state that all transactions should be non-reversible. But can these
non-reversible transactions be a problem? If you for example by accident make a
transfer to a wrong recipent. Without a trusted third party (a bank or a credit
card company), you need to trust the peer you are sending the money and perhaps
all the other peers in the network to return your money after erroneous
transfers. I have not tried using Bitcoins so far, so there may very well be
some kind of safeguards set in the client software against these kinds of
mistakes.

Is _proof-of-work_ the same as one Bitcoin? Seems to me like it is, and if not
then I have mistaken. During a previous lecture about security strategy it was
discussed that at the executive level the language is different to that of IT.
For CISO to get their proposed budget accepted they must explain their needs and
goals in business terms. The Bitcoin paper is in parts quite technical and I
wouldn't mind having a more business terms explanation of the subject. Or
perhaps I would like to have a more hands-on experience. I wonder if it would be
possible to go through the whole Bitcoin lifetime from creation of a single coin to
spending and recieving them to discarding of old transactions, and how would it
be possible to demostrate it.

I think it took about two hours to read the paper and to write about it too.

I don't  need my future Bitcoin wallet to be always online, but do I need it to
be online from time to time? How long can my Bitcoins keep stored in a usb-stick
some where. How should I store them? CD-roms and external drives may break in
time. Is it a stupid idea to try to save up for pension in Bitcoins?

### Narayanan: Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies

> Narayanan: [Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies][3], videos Week 1 (about
> 1 hour) and optionally Week 2 (1,5 h). Requires free registration.

The link to singing up form on the page did not work. Archive.org's Wayback
Machine did't have the page archived either.

I tried disabling Privacy Badger, HTTPS Everywhere and Firefox's built-in
tracking protection, but I still couldn't access the Sign Up form.

To access the Sign Up form it was mandatory to visit the main page
<https://www.coursera.org> and follow the registration process there (with a
throwaway email), and only after that I was able to access the material (with
privacy settings re-eabled, which was nice).

The very beginning was easy to follow and I was familiar with the topics
discussed. Ten minutes in and we have _Commitment API_ with envelopes on the
table and implementing commitments and I was very much lost again. I think I
somewhat understood the things that were being explained, but that it was
presented in a hard to understand manner. The SHA-256 hash function explained
was easy and fun though. Maybe it was the graphics that helped.

Next up a [binary search tree][6] was mentioned. I had to look up the Wikipedia
explanation for this. It's a data structure that stores "items" in memory, and a
lot of mathematics and programming examples were included. I wish this stuff
would have been included in the bachelor's degree. Also the laser pointer
doesn't really work well with the recorded lesson and some sort of enhancement
would be good for the videos.

The signature is valid for only one particular message, because the signature is
a product of a function that takes the message and the private key as arguments.
If the message changes so would the signature. If the private key changes the
signature is different too. I would assume that the digital signatures for email
work the same way. Even though encrypting email at least for popular web mails
is usually not available it would be nice if even the singing of messages would
be more common. But this is another topic.

It would be fun to see/make a coding example of _bad_ randomness to see how it
affects cryptography. Computers have a lot of different ways to make up
randomness. Some of them are said to be cryptographically secure some are
not. But how about making a very non-random generator and see results form that.

Or perhaps an example of a signature of a long(ish) message instead a signature
of a message hash.

The part 1.5 A Simple Cryptocurrency was again easier to understand even though
the previous parts explaining basics of cryptography were a bit difficult
things. The double-spending attack is explained in a nice and easy to understand
way.

Lazy me skipped the programming task but did continue to lectures for Week 2. So
that two weeks worth of lectures in two hours!

Distributed consensus seems a lot like black magic.

_Proof-of-work_ (the thing I was baffled with when reading the Bitcoin paper)
was explained in the video as selecting nodes proportioned to their computing
power. That is in decentralized network when a random node is selected it is not
actually random. Nodes compete with each other in terms of computing power. So
more powerful nodes (or computers) are picked to calculate the next block. These
nodes then get rewarded with new Bitcoins. This means that in order to profit
from running a Bitcoin node a very powerful computer is required.

Getting through both Week 1 and Week 2 of the video series took roughly four
hours. There were a few times when rewatching some part was needed and sometimes
the video would be paused for writing down notes. The videos raised many
questions that are [written down at the end](#so-many-questions-raised).

### Määttä et al 2020: Virtuaalivaluuttojen verotus

## a

> Value of bit money. How much is one BitCoin (BTC) worth now? Using historical
BTC course, show that you could have lost a lot of money investing in BTC. Also
show that you could have won a lot of money with BTC.

## b

> Is it legal to own BitCoin in Finland? Why do you think so?

## c

> What's a block chain? Give a simple but detailed explanation. (Feel free to
> use the most narrow and simple definition of blockchain - no need to consider
> a whole cryptocurrency).

## d

> Not BitCoin. Give examples of some AltCoins, crypto currencies competing with
> BitCoin. For each AltCoin: how does it differ, what's it's claim for fame?

Forks

AltCoins according to Coursera are systems built on BItCoin like principles to
achieve perhaps  slightly different goals. Sometimes currency systems, sometimes
not currency systems such as DNS, public key directory of stock trades.


## f

> Prepare a 5-7 minute presentation on the subject you reserved. We'll have
> presentations next week.

## g

> Voluntary: Buy some BitCoin. If you're new to this, don't risk a lot of
> money.

## h

> want, you can instead check taxation in another country)

## i

> Voluntary: Describe a simple cryptocurrency (you can invent one yourself or
> use an existing toy example).

## j

> Voluntary: Secret or public? Find some transactions on a BitCoin account that
> is related to a case that has had publicity.

### So Many Questions Raised

After the video lessons I came up with ideas for a short presentations. Sadly
the topics were reserved already a week ago, but here are some questions to
think about anyway.

The amount of computing time is significant. So a powerful computer is
required, and this in turn means that more and more electricity is used.

* But what happens if there are no miners within the Bitcoin network? Are blocks
verfied anymore? What will happen after many many years?
* How large a strain does Bitcoin pose to environment?
* Is is unecological to have a node on Bitcoin network? Some statistics can be
  found at [Digiconomist website][7] and it seems that Bitcoin doesn't work
  without somekind of an impact to global energy consumpition and perhaps this
  should be discussed more.
* How would I get my company to accept Bitcoins in transactions?
* How do Bitcoin wallet software work?
* Would a company need multiple Bitcoin wallets?
* What about other digital currencies?
* What is the problem with realtime payments with Bitcoin?
* Can the problem with realtime payments be solved and how?
* How do I purchase Bitcoins safely?
* What is the difference in Bitcoin nodes and Bitcoin wallets?
* What if I have a Bitcoin node, but I don't update my software?
* What would it be like to mine one Bitcoin on paper?
* What others uses of blockchains are there for business?

### Other Lessons Learned

For Mardown code to use word wrap in Visua Studio Code it needs a special entry
in the `settings.json`-file.

```json
    "[markdown]": {
        "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    }
```

And to include hard wrap (new line breaks are automatically inserted) you need
to install an extension named Rewrap.
