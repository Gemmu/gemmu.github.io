### Satoshi Nakamoto 2008: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

This must be at least a third time I've tried reading this original description
of Bitcoin system. I have to admit that even the abstract is a bit difficult to
comprehend with its concepts like _proof-of-work_ and _largest pool of CPU_ and
so on. It is either a humbling experience or just frustrating? Or maybe a little
both.

It does state that all transactions should be non-reversible. But can these
non-reversible transactions be a problem? If you for example by accident make a
transfer to a wrong recipent. Without a trusted third party (a bank or a credit
card company), you need to trust the peer you are sending the money and perhaps
all the other peers in the network to return your money after erroneous
transfers. I have not tried using Bitcoins so far, so there may very well be
some kind of safeguards set in the client software against these kinds of
mistakes.

Is _proof-of-work_ the same as one Bitcoin? Seems to me like it is, and if not
then I have mistaken. During a previous lecture about security strategy it was
discussed that at the executive level the language is different to that of IT.
For CISO to get their proposed budget accepted they must explain their needs and
goals in business terms. The Bitcoin paper is in parts quite technical and I
wouldn't mind having a more business terms explanation of the subject. Or
perhaps I would like to have a more hands-on experience. I wonder if it would be
possible to go through the whole Bitcoin lifetime from creation of a single coin to
spending and recieving them to discarding of old transactions, and how would it
be possible to demostrate it.
