Homework part 6 for course [ICT Security Basics - from Trust to Blockchain][1]

Getting through the literature and videos both Week 1 and Week 2 of the video
series took roughly five hours. There were a few times when rewatching some part
was needed and sometimes the video would be paused for writing down notes.

All in all the homework this week too about twice the time it took previous
times. Many questions are [written down at the end](#so-many-questions-raised).
I think some of them could be answered by wathing the whole video series.

### Satoshi Nakamoto 2008: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

> Satoshi Nakamoto 2008: [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System][2].
> This is the paper that defined and introduced BitCoin. You can skip "11.
> Calculations" if you don't like sigma symbols.

This must be at least third time I've tried reading this original description
of Bitcoin system. I have to admit that even the abstract is a bit difficult to
comprehend with its concepts like _proof-of-work_ and _largest pool of CPU_ and
so on. It is either a humbling experience or just frustrating? Or maybe a little
both.

It does state that all transactions should be non-reversible. But can these
non-reversible transactions be a problem? If you for example by accident make a
transfer to a wrong recipent. Without a trusted third party (a bank or a credit
card company), you need to trust the peer you are sending the money and perhaps
all the other peers in the network to return your money after erroneous
transfers. I have not tried using Bitcoins so far, so there may very well be
some kind of safeguards set in the client software against these kinds of
mistakes.

Is _proof-of-work_ the same as one Bitcoin? Seems to me like it is, and if not
then I have mistaken. During a previous lecture about security strategy it was
discussed that at the executive level the language is different to that of IT.
For CISO to get their proposed budget accepted they must explain their needs and
goals in business terms. The Bitcoin paper is in parts quite technical and I
wouldn't mind having a more business terms explanation of the subject. Or
perhaps I would like to have a more hands-on experience. I wonder if it would be
possible to go through the whole Bitcoin lifetime from creation of a single coin to
spending and recieving them to discarding of old transactions, and how would it
be possible to demostrate it.

### Narayanan: Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies

> Narayanan: [Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies][3], videos Week 1 (about
> 1 hour) and optionally Week 2 (1,5 h). Requires free registration.

The link to singing up form on the page did not work. Archive.org's Wayback
Machine did't have the page archived either.

![Coursera's sign-up was not cooperating](coursera.png?raw=true "Coursera sign up is acting up")

I tried disabling Privacy Badger, HTTPS Everywhere and Firefox's built-in
tracking protection, but I still couldn't access the Sign Up form.

To access the Sign Up form it was required to visit the main page
<https://www.coursera.org> and to follow the registration process there (with a
throwaway email), and only after that I was able to access the material (with
privacy settings re-eabled, which was nice).

The very beginning was easy to follow and I was familiar with the topics
discussed. Ten minutes in and we have _Commitment API_ with envelopes on the
table and implementing commitments and I was very much lost again. I think I
somewhat understood the things that were being explained, but that it was
presented in a hard to understand manner. The SHA-256 hash function explained
was easy and fun though. Maybe it was the graphics that helped.

Next up a [binary search tree][6] was mentioned. I had to look up the Wikipedia
explanation for this. It's a data structure that stores "items" in memory, and a
lot of mathematics and programming examples were included. I wish this stuff
would have been included in the bachelor's degree. Also the laser pointer
doesn't really work well with the recorded lesson and some sort of enhancement
would be good for the videos.

The signature is valid for only one particular message, because the signature is
a product of a function that takes the message and the private key as arguments.
If the message changes so would the signature. If the private key changes the
signature is different too. I would assume that the digital signatures for email
work the same way. Even though encrypting email at least for popular web mails
is usually not available it would be nice if even the singing of messages would
be more common. But this is another topic.

It would be fun to see/make a coding example of _bad_ randomness to see how it
affects cryptography. Computers have a lot of different ways to make up
randomness. Some of them are said to be cryptographically secure some are
not. But how about making a very non-random generator and see results form that.
Or perhaps an example of a signature of a long(ish) message instead a signature
of a message hash.

The part _A Simple Cryptocurrency_ was again easier to understand even though
the previous parts explaining basics of cryptography were a bit difficult
things. The double-spending attack is explained in a nice and easy to understand
way.

I skipped the programming task, but I did continue to lectures for Week 2. So
that two weeks worth of lectures in 2,5 hours! Distributed consensus seems a lot
like black magic.

_Proof-of-work_ (the thing I was baffled with when reading the Bitcoin paper)
was explained in the video as selecting nodes proportioned to their computing
power. That is in decentralized network when a random node is selected it is not
actually random. Nodes compete with each other in terms of computing power. So
more powerful nodes (or computers) are picked to calculate the next block. These
nodes then get rewarded with new Bitcoins. This means that in order to profit
from running a Bitcoin node a very powerful computer is required.

The videos did a great work at explaining this cryptocurrency thing. But I think
that the Week 2 part was required to really understand things as the first week
just goes through some fundamentals of cryptography (and was a bit hard to
follow in parts).

### Määttä et al 2020: Virtuaalivaluuttojen verotus

It is indeed a long document. It starts by stating that a cryptocurrency is not
a legal means of payment, but that it is something that can be used as means of
payment by persons. There is no legal obligation to accept any cryptocurrency
because it is not an official currency.

If one trades this virtual money to any official currency it is required to pay
taxes from the profit you make. But if you trade virtual currency to another
virtual currency you are also obligated to pay taxes from your profits. Unless
the value is less than 1000 euros per year.

The whole taxation seems quite complex and using cryptocurrency to make any
online purchases is down right awful. One has to keep track of original coin
value as well as the value at the time of spending them, and one may have to pay
taxes if the value has increased and is now used to purchase other goods. But
then again the same is true for other currency trading I guess.

## a

> Value of bit money. How much is one BitCoin (BTC) worth now? Using historical
BTC course, show that you could have lost a lot of money investing in BTC. Also
show that you could have won a lot of money with BTC.

There are many different websites where Bitcoins can be purchased. [Bitcoin.org
site warns][8] that

> Exchanges provide highly varying degrees of safety, security, privacy, and
> control over your funds and information. Perform your own due diligence and
> choose a wallet where you will keep your bitcoin before selecting an exchange.

With that in mind I selected randomly an exchange named bitcoin.de that was
listed to operate under Europe. The website showed that the current price of one
[Bitcoin was 8675,60 €][9] on 16. May, which is a clear sign that I'm not about
to purchase a Bitcoin any time soon.

![Bitcoin value 16. May 2020](bitcoin-value.png?raw=true "Bitcoin value 16. May 2020 was 8675,60 €")

Lucily you don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin, you can purchase a fraction of a
Bitcoin through these Exchange sites that seem to operate 24 hours a day all
week long.

The price of Bitcoin has greatly risen in time. There was a
[five year diagram][10] available on the site that showed a quick development on
the price in Autumn 2017 with a top price of over 19 000 €. After that the price
quickly lowered during 2018.

![Bitcoin price development](bitcoin-price-development.png?raw=true "Bitcoin price development")

There have been news about [making insane profits with Bitcoin][11] as well as
news about people [missing out on the huge profits][12]. Sadly I myself didn't
have any Bitcoins back then so I didn't become a millionaire, nor did I get any
pizza.

Bitcoin seems to be quite volatile so it remains to be seen what the future
holds for it. Will there be a new group of ultra rich? Will it lose all of its
value? Last year it bought you a pizza, now it would be worth
millions, _or_ last year it bought you a pizza, now you wouldn't get an empty
box with it. Both very possible futures. Who knows?

## b

> Is it legal to own BitCoin in Finland? Why do you think so?

Well according to the [taxation guidelines][4] in the literature part, the
cryptocurrency itself is not a legal tender per se. But it is acnowledged that
it can be used in trade of other currencies, cryptocurrencies and services and
goods. Only thing that tax authority is concerned is that ones using it pay
their taxes as mandated.

So as long as you pay your taxes if you happen to make a profit, eg. the price
of Bitcoin when you spend it is higher than when you aquired it, it's OK in the
eyes of Finnish law.

## c

> What's a blockchain? Give a simple but detailed explanation. (Feel free to
> use the most narrow and simple definition of blockchain - no need to consider
> a whole cryptocurrency).

Blockchain is a sort of ledger or a registry of different transactions and it
is used to keep the trasactions valid. To reiterate the CIA rule the blockchain
protects the integrity of transactions.

Each blocks in the chain contains some kind of new information along with
information about the previous block. Blocks use the information they contain
and the information from previous block to formulate mathematical codes that are
only valid between two certain blocks. These codes are then used by the
subsequent block to make new codes.

## d

> Not BitCoin. Give examples of some AltCoins, cryptocurrencies competing with
> BitCoin. For each AltCoin: how does it differ, what's it's claim for fame?

I'm not fully convinced yet that Bitcoin of cryptocurrency in current form will
prevail. Maybe it will, maybe it will not. In any case multiple cryptocurrencies
have surfaced and some of them compete with Bitcoin, others are there just for
the heck of it.

### OneCoin

[This was just a scam][]. A big scam. A huge scam. A ponzi scheme which is a type of
a pyramid scheme. A new cryptocurrency was promoted and real money was collected
but nothing ever realized and one of the original fraudsters is still on the
run.

What is weird is that a lot of news sources reported OneCoin to be a
get-rich-quick and still it took very long to shut down. I think most people
are wired to believe in these promises of wealth and fortune.

It rode with the rising fame of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It was at
the same time as Bitcoins price had started to rise significatly so I guess
everyone were very exited and expectations were very high with these.

The market place for OneCoin shut down at the beginning of 2017 and during that
year Bitcoin rose to all time high. Maybe OneCoin's departure gave way to
Bitcoin.

### Ethereum

Ethereum is another cryptocurrency whose name I saw on the [bitcoin.de][9] site.

What they say [about themselves][19]:

> On Ethereum, you can write code that controls digital value, runs exactly as
> programmed, and is accessible anywhere in the world.

I can't really make anything out of that. Let's read more on the [What is
Ethereum page][20]

> Ethereum is the foundation for a new era of the internet

I see.

> Ethereum is the world’s programmable blockchain

The what now?

> Ethereum has a native cryptocurrency called Ether

Ah. So the currensy is not called Ethereum at all, but _Ether_. I stand
corrected.

> But unlike other blockchains, Ethereum can do much more

That sounds exiting tell me more.

> developers can use it to build new kinds of applications

Right. So it's a programming language?

> Right now, thousands of developers all over the world are building
> applications on Ethereum

This is the first time I've everd heard about it. How many developers are there
around the world. Is thousands a lot or is it little? Can't really say. I do
know one developer who seems to claims to be an Ethereum developer. So maybe
that's something.

Ethereum also seems to have its own [StackExchange site] so maybe it is not a
scam after all.

### Dogecoin

Much Dogecoin! So free! Wow! I first came to know Dogecoin through
[rasterbators][16] donation widget. Rasterbator is a site that let's you print
huge posters using regular A4 paper.

![Rasterbator donation](rasterbator.png?raw=true "Rasterbator needs halp!")

As it is stated on [its web site][17]:

> Dogecoin sets it self apart from other digital currencies with an amazing,
> vibrant community made up of friendly folks just like you.

So I think the winning card here is the nice Shiba Inu dog and that the whole
thing is set up to feel very friendly and welcoming. It puts away with all the
"Wall Street vibes".

Using Dogecoin "faucets" one can allegendly aquire Dogecoins free of charge. So
it's 100 % profit every time propably when it comes to taxation in Finland.

Seems legit. This has to be my favourite cryptocurrency so far.

## f

> Prepare a 5-7 minute presentation on the subject you reserved. We'll have
> presentations next week.

I'll see what I can do. This homework took much of my saturday so what ever I
come up with on sunday will have to do.

## g

> money.

Maybe later.

## h

> Voluntary: When do you have to pay taxes for BitCoin in Finland? (If you
> want, you can instead check taxation in another country)

According to [vero.fi][4] every time you make a transaction with a Bitcoin you
have to keep track on the value of your Bitcoin investment, the price it was
bought with and the price of the goods you are purchasing with them.

It doesn't matter if you are buying other crypto currencies or food of just
transferring them to money, if the value of the Bitcoins you own has gone up,
you have to pay the income tax.

## i

> Voluntary: Describe a simple cryptocurrency (you can invent one yourself or
> use an existing toy example).

I better not. The people on the videos made so much better job at explaining it
with [Goofymoney][3] that I'm afraid I would just make a fool out of myself. I think
I understand the concept. But it's a bit difficult for me to explain.

Cryptocurrency is a series of numbers that hold a value according to people who
have invested in it.

Creator of a coin can pass it to another person and signs the transaction with
their private key. The new owner of the coin can then transfer it to someone
else and signs the new transaction with their private key. Anyone can validate
the transactions using the public keys of the participants. This is propably
over simplification but may do.

## j

> Voluntary: Secret or public? Find some transactions on a BitCoin account that
> is related to a case that has had publicity.

[Bitcoin Pizza Day][22] was the day that 10000 (ten thousand) Bitcoins were
spent to purchase two pizzas. Today worth several millions. Link to transaction
was found in [Bitcoin Wiki][23]. This transaction was part of a block `57043`
that comprised of two different transactions on 22. May 2010. Miner of the block
is stated as Unknown. 

The 10000 Bitcoins were put together from over a hundred coins some worth a
fraction of a coin and some worth up to 305 Bitcoins.


### So Many Questions Raised

After the video lessons I came up with ideas for a short presentations. Sadly
the topics were reserved already a week ago, but here are some questions to
think about anyway.

The amount of computing time is significant. So a powerful computer is
required, and this in turn means that more and more electricity is used.

* Do I need my future Bitcoin wallet to be always online, or do I need it to
be online from time to time?
* How long can my Bitcoins keep stored on a usb-stick some where?
* How should I store them?
* Is it a good idea to try to save up for pension in Bitcoins?
* But what happens if there are no miners within the Bitcoin network? Are blocks
verfied anymore? What will happen after many many years?
* How large a strain does Bitcoin pose to environment?
* Is is unecological to have a node on Bitcoin network? Some statistics can be
  found at [Digiconomist website][7] and it seems that Bitcoin doesn't work
  without somekind of an impact to global energy consumpition and perhaps this
  should be discussed more.
* How would I get my company to accept Bitcoins in transactions?
* How do Bitcoin wallet software work?
* Would a company need multiple Bitcoin wallets?
* What about other digital currencies?
* What is the problem with realtime payments with Bitcoin?
* Can the problem with realtime payments be solved and how?
* How do I purchase Bitcoins safely?
* What is the difference in Bitcoin nodes and Bitcoin wallets?
* What if I have a Bitcoin node, but I don't update my software?
* What would it be like to mine one Bitcoin on paper?
* What others uses of blockchains are there for business?

### Other Lessons Learned

For Mardown code to use word wrap in Visua Studio Code it needs a special entry
in the `settings.json`-file.

```json
    "[markdown]": {
        "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    }
```

And to include hard wrap (new line breaks are automatically inserted) you need
to install an extension named Rewrap.
