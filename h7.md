How to use a password manager when you have multiple devices and you need the
passwords available on each? 

It is password managers that are all the rage these days. [XKCD's guidance][8] is
[not wanted anymore][7], because it is thought that passwords are more secure
when it is easy update them more often. Most of us require to use our passwords
on mobile phones and computers so having the same set of passwords availble on
all devices is necessary.

This presentation sees through a couple of options to handle syncin of passwords
accross multiple devices.

## Password Manager as a Service

### F-Secure KEY

Syncing option between devices available for a yearly fee.

Passwords are [stored in the device][2] but also in [F-Secure hosted][3]
servers.

### 1Password

Syncing option available for a "monthly" fee (billed annually).

### LastPass

located in the US, their [privacy policy][9] also follows the US laws.

They do have free tier accounts with limited features and this is propably why
the service is so popular.

## Web Storage

For this you need a password manager that are able to use local(ish) files. One
would need a client software installed on each device capable of accessing a
remote file. KeePass and KeePassXC are the most popular ones. KeePass is the
original and the XC-derivant is a crossplatform version.

KeepassXC has no official version for iOS or Android, but they have
recommendations for applications that are compatible with its fileformat.

iPhone app Strongbox is recommended by KeePassXC and is also listed on Keepass's
web site.

KeePass2Android is recommended for Android users by KeePassXC and listed as
compatible by KeePass.

### Dropbox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive

Should you trust the service provider you can sync it with  it here

### WebDAV

Both Strongbox and KeePass2Android are able to sync password database through
WeDAV that could be hosted with [local Nextcloud install][5]

### SFTP

Both Strongbox and KeePass2Android are able to sync password database through
SFTP that could be hosted from your local network.

## USB or Bluetooth

One can connect the mobile phone to a computer and sync the password files
that way. This does sound like an easy solution. It requires that the files are
stored in a directory structure that is accessible by the computer, but this
shouldn't be a problem.

## Host Your Own Password Manager

### Bitwarden

Bitwarden is a password manager that is availble for a price like F-Secure KEY
or 1Password. But it is also possible to [host Bitwarden locally][6]. Some
restrictions on the features that are available apply, which is a bit odd. The
premium features aren't explained in much detail. But it seems that it is
quite possible to host it with at least two different users.

### Nextcloud

Nexcloud is software for your own private cloud. It differs from Bitwarden in
that in addition of using it as a password manager it can be used as a file
storage, contact information, calendars and syncing all these with your devices.

There are a dedicated apps for iOS and Android, but it is limited to managing
useds files. The password managers features can be accessed through Nextclouds
web-interface, which is a bit more cumbersome than a dedicated app. It has an
extension for Firefox and Chrome browsers though, so logging to websites is easy
enough.

This will probably be my goto solution as I've had Nextcloud installed before
and it is not limited to just managing passwords.

## Conclusion

Do you trust the service provider? Do you have money to pay for it? If you do
Then the service providers are propably an easy solution.

If you like to tinker with code and are confident in keeping your servers
secure(ish) then SFTP or a Nextcloud install could work just fine with
KeePass(XC).

Using an online storage service like Dropbox for storing the passwords file is a
sort of a middle ground. You are not locked in to particular serivice provider
with storage.

If the alternative is writing down passwords on paper then propably any one of
these is a good option.
