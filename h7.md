How to use a password manager when you have multiple devices and you need the
passwords available on each? 

It is password managers that are all the rage these days. [XKCD's guidance][8] is
[not wanted anymore][7], because it is thought that passwords are more secure
when it is easy update them more often. Most of us require to use our passwords
on mobile phones and computers so having the same set of passwords availble on
all devices is necessary.

This presentation sees through a couple of options for syncing of
passwords accross multiple devices.

## Password Manager as a Service

There are many options when selecting an online password manager. The
differences are mostly in pricing and 

### F-Secure KEY

Finnish company providing password management along with many different security
related products. The password manager is free, but syncing between devices is 
available only in the premium version for a yearly fee.

Passwords are [stored in the device][2] but also in [F-Secure hosted][3]
servers.

Quote from F-Secure KEY's [privacy policy][3]:

> F-Secure operates globally. Consequently, some of our affiliates,
> subcontractors, distributors, and partners are located outside the European
> Economic Area to ensure the global reach and availability of our services.

> In some cases, we may also accept other mechanisms to justify transfer outside
> the EEA. Such other justifications include providing data to entities who have
> registered under the United States’ Privacy Shield program or providing data
> to entities processing such data in countries with an adequate level of
> privacy legislation that safeguards the data subject’s rights.

### 1Password

Canadian company named AgileBits Inc. Like F-Secure KEY it allows syncing option
only for a "monthly" fee (that is billed annually).

Quote from 1Password's [privacy policy][10]:

> complies with Canadian privacy laws. We are fully compliant with the Canadian
> privacy laws and the GDPR. The European Union (“EU”) recognizes Canada as a
> destination country with “adequate level of protection”

> Secure Data are the data that we are not capable of decrypting under any
> circumstance. It includes all information stored within vaults in 1Password
> accounts. These data are encrypted using secure cryptographic keys that exist
> only in the possession and under the control of our customers. We have no way
> of accessing or providing decrypted Secure Data, and we never receive copies
> of unencrypted Secure Data.

### LastPass

LastPass is owned by an US based company LogMeIn. Because the company is
located in the US, it must also follows US laws.

Quote from LastPass's [privacy policy][9]:

> ...sometimes provide personal information to third parties...
> ...required to disclose personal information that we handle under the Privacy
> Shield in response to lawful requests by public authorities

They do have free tier accounts with limited features and this is propably why
the service is so popular. It also features peculiar elements of sharing the
access to passwords to other LastPass users and recoverin of master password by
SMS.

## Web Storage

For this you need a password manager uses password database files. KeePass
and KeePassXC are popular ones. KeePass is the original and the XC-derivant is a
crossplatform version. Neither have an official iOS or Android client, but they
do exist. Strongbox for iPhone and KeePass2Android for Android users.

### Dropbox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive

If you trust the service provider, you can save the password file in to web
drive and sync it from there. Both iPhone and Android apps support this.

### WebDAV

Both Strongbox and KeePass2Android are able to sync password database through
WeDAV that could be hosted with [local Nextcloud install][5] Apache's HTTP
server or [several others][11].

### SFTP

Both Strongbox and KeePass2Android are able to sync password database through
[SFTP][12] that could be hosted from your local network.

## USB or Bluetooth

One can connect the mobile phone to a computer and sync the password files
that way. This does sound like an easy solution. It requires that the files are
stored in a directory structure that is accessible by the computer, but this
shouldn't be a problem at least with Android phones.

## Host Your Own Password Manager

### Bitwarden

Bitwarden is a password manager that is availble for a price like F-Secure KEY
or 1Password. But it is also possible to [host Bitwarden locally][6]. Some
restrictions on the features that are available apply, which is a bit odd. The
premium features aren't explained in much detail. But it seems that it is
quite possible to host it with at least two different users.

### Nextcloud

Nexcloud is software for your own private cloud. It differs from Bitwarden in
that in addition of using it as a password manager it can be used as a file
storage, contact information, calendars and syncing all these with your devices.

There are a dedicated apps for iOS and Android, but it is limited to managing
useds files. The password managers features can be accessed through Nextclouds
web-interface, which is a bit more cumbersome than a dedicated app. It has an
extension for Firefox and Chrome browsers though, so logging to websites is easy
enough.

This will probably be my goto solution as I've had Nextcloud installed before
and it is not limited to just managing passwords.

## Conclusion

So there you are. Service provides, self hosting services or USB-cables. There
are many options for this.

Do you trust the service provider? Do you have money to pay for it? If you do
Then the service providers are propably an easy solution.

If you like to tinker with code and are confident in keeping your servers
secure(ish) then SFTP or a Nextcloud install could work just fine with
KeePass(XC).

Using an online storage service like Dropbox for storing the passwords file is a
sort of a middle ground. You are not locked in to particular serivice provider
with storage.

If the alternative is writing down passwords on paper then propably any one of
these is a good option.
