# Homework For ICT4HM003-3001

There was a requirement to return homework as a website link

So I installed Visul Studio Code and Git on to my Windows machine. Might as well have used the Ubuntu in VirtualBOx but this is more exiting. Isn't it?

## h1

### a

_Pick a security incident and learn about it. Write briefly about it. Point out the concepts of threat actor, exploit, vulnerability, impact and risk_



### b

_Use either (Hutchins et al 2011) cyber kill chain or MITRE ATT&CK framework for analyzing the incident you used in a. You can pick any incident you want, but try to pick a source that gives you enough technical and business detail to do some analysis. (If you're in a hurry, cyber kill chain is much simpler. If you're technically skillful, you might find ATT&CK be very interesting)_

### c

_Use attack tree to analyze the security of some imaginary example target._

### d

_MITTRE ATT&CK is about tactics, techniques and procedures. Give example of each from the framework._


### e

_Accept course rules in Moodle, so that we can talk about practical exploits._



### f

_Voluntary bonus: What do you consider the fundamentals of security? What are the theoretical foundations you would teach on the first day?_
