# Homework For Security Basics

There was a requirement to return homework as a website link. I did not have a
website readily available, but GitHub pages came to rescue. So I installed
Visual Studio Code and Git on to my Windows machine. Might as well have used the
Ubuntu in VirtualBox but this is more exiting. Isn't it? I haven't really used
Windows for coding, that is, at least not with Git.

I thing the web pages only -requirement should be mentioned even before the
course begins. In the preliminary email for example. If it was mentioned I
appologise, but I first saw the requirement in Moodles submission form. It came
as a bit of a surprise.
